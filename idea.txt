How CI/CD + Kubernetes fit into an ML project (super simple)

Idea:

CI (Continuous Integration) checks your code + model artifacts on every push: style, tests, small sanity checks.

CD (Continuous Delivery/Deployment) packages your app (with the model) into a Docker image and deploys it automatically.

Kubernetes runs that Docker image reliably (multiple replicas, auto-restart, rolling updates), so your model is always available.

Think of it as: commit → tests → build image → push image → deploy to K8s → live API.
